Non- functional Requirements
NFR01.
The platform must be Android and minimum version Of Android.
NFR02- Usability
The system should be easy to work for modelling, visualizing of the soft body and interacting with it. For example, varying the parameters at runtime needs a GUI for that so user can enter the parameters easily or allowing user to add multiple displays for a simulation.
NFR03- Response Time
The system must response at a reasonable time. For some applications, response at real time is important, whereas for others are not.
NFR04- Resource Utilization
Identifies how much resource is needed at a unit of time so that the system can operate.
This non-functional requirement depends on the efficiency of algorithms. For a given time step, the more computation is needed, the more resources are needed for Computation.
NFR05- Accuracy
Identifies how the created soft body object and its behaviour at simulation time are near to reality. Accuracy depends on LOD and time step. Less time step and more LOD lead to a more accurate soft body object.
NFR06- Portability
The system should work on other platforms and operating systems.
NFR07- Stability
The simulation shouldnâ€™t crash at simulation time. Stability depends on the size of time
both in shape and behaviour and response to the actions in real time.
